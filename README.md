# Bulls and Cows game

Another project while learning on JetBrains Academy. 

The code allows the generation of pseudo random secret code with unique digits and letters (up to 36 symbols: numbers from 0 to 9 and lower case letter a to z).

Some screenshots:

Starting the game and setting the code length and number of symbols:
